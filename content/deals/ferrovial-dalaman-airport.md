Ferrovial announced in September 2025 that it had secured the rights to a 30-year concession to operate Dalaman Airport on Turkey's southwestern coast, in a deal valued at approximately EUR 1.5 billion (roughly $1.6 billion). The concession was awarded through a competitive tender process administered by Turkey's State Airports Authority (DHMI), with Ferrovial outbidding several other international airport operators. The deal includes commitments to invest in a new terminal expansion and runway improvements to accommodate projected passenger growth.

Dalaman Airport serves as the primary gateway for international visitors to the Fethiye, Oludeniz, and Marmaris tourism regions, which attract millions of European tourists annually. The airport handled approximately 10 million passengers in 2024, with summer peak months seeing over 1.5 million monthly passengers. Ferrovial's investment thesis is built on Turkey's growing appeal as a cost-competitive Mediterranean tourism destination, with passenger volumes expected to grow at a 5-7% compound annual rate over the concession's initial decade.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals from Turkish competition authorities and aviation regulators, with closing expected in the first quarter of 2026. Ferrovial plans to deploy its proprietary airport management platform, which has driven commercial revenue optimization at its existing airports, to improve Dalaman's per-passenger retail and food-and-beverage spending. The concession agreement includes inflation-linked aeronautical fee adjustments and minimum capital expenditure requirements tied to passenger volume thresholds.
