Mirova announced in January 2026 a $600 million investment to acquire a controlling stake in the Lake Victoria Water Treatment Joint Venture, a landmark water infrastructure platform serving approximately 8 million people across Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. The transaction, structured as a combination of equity acquisition and committed growth capital, represented one of the largest private investments in water infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa and aligned with Mirova's mandate to deploy capital in projects that generate measurable social and environmental impact alongside financial returns. The deal was supported by co-investment from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), which provided concessional financing to enhance the project's bankability.

The joint venture's infrastructure comprised three large-scale water treatment plants drawing from Lake Victoria, the world's second-largest freshwater lake, along with 850 kilometers of distribution pipeline and associated pumping stations. The facilities employed advanced multi-barrier treatment processes to address the unique water quality challenges of Lake Victoria, including seasonal algal blooms and elevated turbidity levels, producing treated water that met World Health Organization drinking water standards. The system served a rapidly growing population in urban and peri-urban areas around the lake, where access to safe, reliable piped water had historically been severely limited, with many communities relying on untreated surface water or expensive water vendors.

Mirova's investment plan included expansion of treatment capacity by approximately 40% over five years, extension of the distribution network to reach an additional 3 million people, and implementation of smart metering and remote monitoring systems to reduce non-revenue water losses, which currently exceeded 35% across the network. The deal was structured with tariff frameworks agreed with national water regulatory authorities in all three countries, incorporating affordability provisions to ensure that low-income households could access basic water services at subsidized rates while generating sufficient revenues to service debt and provide returns to equity investors.
