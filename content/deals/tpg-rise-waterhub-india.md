TPG Rise Climate announced in August 2025 the acquisition of WaterHub India for $900 million, securing a leading decentralized water treatment and recycling platform that addresses one of India's most pressing environmental infrastructure challenges. WaterHub India operates 85 modular water treatment facilities across 12 Indian states, providing advanced membrane-based water recycling services to industrial customers in water-intensive sectors including textiles, pharmaceuticals, automotive manufacturing, and food processing. The company's proprietary treatment systems achieve water recovery rates exceeding 95%, significantly reducing industrial freshwater consumption and wastewater discharge.

India's industrial water sector faces acute supply constraints, with the country's Central Water Commission projecting that demand will outstrip available freshwater supply by 2030 in several major industrial corridors. The Indian government's Zero Liquid Discharge mandate for highly polluting industries and the National Water Mission's targets for water use efficiency have created a regulatory environment strongly supportive of decentralized water recycling solutions. WaterHub's asset-light, modular deployment model allows rapid scaling to meet this demand, with typical facility installation timelines of 6-9 months compared to 3-5 years for centralized municipal water treatment plants.

TPG Rise Climate plans to invest an additional $300 million to expand WaterHub's platform to 200 facilities by 2028, with a particular focus on semiconductor fabrication clusters, electric vehicle battery manufacturing zones, and data center hubs that require ultra-pure water. The acquisition includes WaterHub's proprietary AI-based water quality monitoring platform, which uses real-time sensor data and machine learning to optimize treatment processes and predict maintenance needs. The deal is subject to approval by the Competition Commission of India and clearance under India's foreign exchange management regulations.
