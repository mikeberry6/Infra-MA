Blackstone completed its acquisition of QTS Realty Trust in a take-private transaction valued at approximately $10 billion, including the assumption of debt, making it one of the largest data center deals in history at the time. QTS operates a portfolio of mega-scale data center campuses across North America's most critical digital infrastructure markets, including the world's densest data center corridor in Northern Virginia, as well as major facilities in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, Chicago, and Richmond. The platform encompasses over 7 million square feet of data center space with substantial additional capacity under development and a significant pipeline of powered land for future expansion.

The acquisition was a cornerstone of Blackstone's thesis on digital infrastructure as a generational investment opportunity. Within months of closing, the explosive growth in demand for AI training and inference compute capacity validated the investment far beyond initial projections. Hyperscale cloud providers and AI companies rushed to secure data center capacity, driving lease-up rates and rental prices to unprecedented levels. Blackstone committed to investing over $15 billion in QTS expansion, with plans to more than triple the platform's total capacity through new campus developments in existing markets and strategic entry into emerging data center hubs.

The QTS platform benefited from several structural advantages that attracted Blackstone's capital, including control of large, powered land parcels near major utility substations — an increasingly scarce and valuable resource as power availability has become the primary constraint on data center development across North America. QTS's purpose-built facilities were designed for the high power densities required by modern GPU-intensive AI workloads, differentiating the platform from older colocation facilities struggling to accommodate next-generation computing requirements. The deal established Blackstone as one of the world's largest private owners of data center infrastructure and demonstrated the firm's ability to deploy capital at scale in the sector.
