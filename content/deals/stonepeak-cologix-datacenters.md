Stonepeak Partners completed its acquisition of Cologix, one of North America's largest network-neutral colocation and interconnection platforms, in a deal valued at approximately $3.5 billion. Cologix operates a portfolio of more than 50 data centers across key North American markets including Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Columbus, Jacksonville, and Minneapolis, providing carrier-neutral colocation, cloud on-ramp connectivity, and managed interconnection services to over 2,000 enterprise and network customers. The platform's network-neutral positioning — hosting equipment and connectivity from hundreds of network carriers and cloud providers without favoring any single operator — makes it a critical node in North America's digital infrastructure ecosystem.

The transaction came amid an unprecedented surge in demand for data center capacity, driven by the rapid scaling of artificial intelligence training and inference workloads, continued enterprise cloud migration, and the expansion of edge computing architectures. Cologix's presence in Canadian markets proved particularly attractive, as Montreal and Toronto have emerged as leading destinations for hyperscale and AI-focused data center development due to their access to abundant, low-cost hydroelectric power and favorable climate conditions for cooling. Stonepeak committed to an aggressive expansion program, with plans to more than double Cologix's total capacity over the following three years.

Stonepeak's deep experience in digital infrastructure — including prior investments in fiber networks, wireless towers, and subsea cable systems — positioned the firm to unlock operational synergies and drive strategic growth across the Cologix platform. The deal reflected a broader pattern of infrastructure-focused private capital flowing into the data center sector at record levels, as investors recognized that AI-driven demand was fundamentally reshaping the capacity requirements and investment case for colocation and hyperscale facilities across North America.
