Sequoia Economic Infrastructure Income Fund closed its EUR 2.8 billion (approximately $3.1 billion) acquisition of a regulated water treatment subsidiary from Ervia, the Irish state-owned utility holding company, in October 2024. The transaction was part of a broader restructuring of Ireland's water infrastructure, following the government's decision to establish Uisce Eireann as an independent public utility. The carved-out subsidiary encompasses advanced water treatment plants, desalination facilities, and distribution infrastructure serving the greater Dublin region.

The acquisition provided Sequoia with a regulated utility platform generating predictable, inflation-linked revenues under a regulatory framework overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). Ireland's water sector has been undergoing a multi-decade investment cycle to address decades of underinvestment, with the CRU authorizing substantial capital expenditure programs to upgrade aging infrastructure, reduce leakage rates, and expand capacity to support the country's rapid population growth and housing construction targets.

The deal was financed through a combination of equity from Sequoia's dedicated infrastructure fund, senior secured debt raised in the European institutional debt market, and a revolving credit facility to fund near-term capital expenditure. Sequoia committed to the CRU's five-year investment plan, which mandates over EUR 1.5 billion in network upgrades, new treatment capacity, and environmental compliance improvements. The regulatory asset base structure ensures that prudent capital investments are reflected in future allowed revenues, providing the fund's investors with long-duration, real-return cash flows.
