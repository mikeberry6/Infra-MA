Warburg Pincus announced in August 2024 the termination of its $1.5 billion planned acquisition of Zenith Energy, an integrated energy storage platform encompassing petroleum product storage, LNG terminaling, and a promising battery energy storage development pipeline. The deal, originally announced in March 2024, had been subject to extended regulatory review by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state environmental agencies, particularly regarding the environmental impact assessments for Zenith's two LNG import terminals on the Gulf Coast. After months of delays and uncertainty surrounding the permitting timeline, both parties mutually agreed to terminate the transaction.

The failed acquisition highlighted the growing regulatory complexity surrounding energy infrastructure transactions in the United States, particularly those involving fossil fuel assets amid heightened political scrutiny of LNG export and import facilities. Environmental advocacy groups had mounted significant opposition to the deal, arguing that a change in ownership could lead to expanded operations at the LNG terminals without adequate environmental review. Warburg Pincus had initially been attracted to the deal by the combination of stable cash-flowing storage assets and the optionality embedded in Zenith's battery energy storage development pipeline, which was positioned to serve grid operators in ERCOT, CAISO, and PJM markets.

Following the termination, Zenith Energy indicated it would explore alternative strategic options, including a potential partial sale of its battery storage development pipeline to a dedicated clean energy investor while retaining its legacy petroleum storage operations. Warburg Pincus redirected its infrastructure capital toward other opportunities in the energy transition space, with market sources indicating the firm was evaluating several standalone battery storage and renewable energy platforms.
