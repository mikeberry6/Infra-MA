Brookfield Infrastructure Partners announced the termination of its proposed $1.2 billion acquisition of regulated electric and gas distribution utility operations serving the Des Moines metropolitan area, following a protracted and ultimately unsuccessful regulatory approval process. The Iowa Utilities Board, after extensive public hearings and a multi-month review, declined to approve the transaction on the grounds that the transfer of ownership to a foreign-domiciled infrastructure fund had not been demonstrated to be in the long-term public interest of Iowa ratepayers. The decision reflected growing political and regulatory scrutiny of private infrastructure fund ownership of essential public utilities in the United States.

The proposed deal would have given Brookfield ownership of electric and gas distribution assets serving approximately 800,000 customers across central Iowa, adding a high-quality regulated utility platform to Brookfield's existing North American utilities portfolio. Brookfield had proposed commitments including multi-year rate freezes, workforce retention guarantees, and accelerated capital investment in grid modernization and renewable energy integration. However, consumer advocacy groups and several state legislators raised concerns about the implications of transferring a community utility asset to a globally diversified investment fund, questioning whether long-term incentives would remain aligned with local customer interests.

The termination of the transaction highlighted the challenges that infrastructure funds increasingly face when pursuing acquisitions of regulated public utilities in the United States, where state-level regulatory bodies retain significant discretion over ownership changes and have shown a growing willingness to block transactions that do not clearly demonstrate ratepayer benefits. For Brookfield, the outcome represented a setback but not a fundamental shift in strategy — the firm continued to pursue regulated utility opportunities in other jurisdictions where the regulatory framework was more accommodating to institutional infrastructure investment. The failed deal also contributed to a broader industry conversation about how infrastructure funds can better engage with regulators and communities when proposing utility acquisitions.
