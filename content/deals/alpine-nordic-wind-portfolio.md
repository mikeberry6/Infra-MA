Alpine Energy Capital has completed the acquisition of a 2.1 GW onshore wind portfolio spanning three Nordic countries from Strandvik Energy. The transaction closed following receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and antitrust clearances.

## Strategic Rationale

The portfolio provides Alpine with immediate scale in the Nordic power market, which benefits from strong wind resources, supportive regulatory frameworks, and increasing demand for green electricity from corporate offtakers and data center operators. The region's well-developed grid infrastructure minimizes curtailment risk.

## Key Considerations

- Portfolio generates approximately 6.5 TWh of annual electricity output
- 85% of production is contracted under fixed-price or CfD arrangements with investment-grade counterparties
- Embedded optionality through 400 MW of permitted repowering potential at older sites
- The acquisition was financed with a combination of equity from Alpine Fund IV and project-level green bond issuance
