PATRIZIA SE completed a EUR 1.8 billion (approximately $2.0 billion) acquisition of a portfolio of 22 hospital and specialized healthcare facilities spanning Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. The transaction represented one of the largest healthcare infrastructure deals in European history and cemented PATRIZIA's position as a leading investor in social infrastructure across the continent. The portfolio was acquired on behalf of several of PATRIZIA's institutional client mandates, including European pension funds and insurance companies seeking stable, inflation-protected income streams with minimal correlation to broader economic cycles.

The facilities, totaling approximately 480,000 square meters, ranged from large acute care hospitals to specialized rehabilitation centers and outpatient clinics, all leased to public health authorities and regional hospital trusts under long-term agreements with weighted average unexpired lease terms exceeding 20 years. The leases featured annual inflation-linked rent escalation mechanisms tied to national consumer price indices, providing a robust hedge against rising costs. Occupancy was effectively 100%, reflecting the essential nature of healthcare services and the creditworthiness of the sovereign-backed tenant base. The portfolio's geographic diversification across three Nordic countries with AAA-rated sovereign credit provided additional risk mitigation.

PATRIZIA indicated it would invest an additional EUR 150 million in capital improvements across the portfolio over the following five years, focusing on energy efficiency upgrades, seismic resilience enhancements, and the integration of smart building management systems to improve operational performance. The firm also highlighted the strong demographic tailwinds supporting healthcare infrastructure investment in Scandinavia, where aging populations and growing demand for specialized medical services were expected to drive sustained public healthcare spending for decades to come.
