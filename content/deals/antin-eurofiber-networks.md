Antin Infrastructure Partners completed its EUR 3.8 billion (approximately $4.1 billion) acquisition of Eurofiber Group, one of Europe's largest independent fiber-optic network operators, in a deal that underscored the premium valuations being accorded to high-quality digital infrastructure assets. The transaction provided Antin with control of over 52,000 kilometers of fiber-optic network spanning the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and France, along with a growing portfolio of carrier-neutral data center colocation facilities and managed connectivity services. Eurofiber's customer base of more than 6,000 enterprises and government entities, connected through long-term contracts with high switching costs, generated predictable recurring revenues with attractive growth characteristics.

The acquisition was driven by the structural demand for high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity fueled by cloud computing adoption, 5G network densification, and the proliferation of data-intensive applications including artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads. Eurofiber's network, characterized by its deep metro penetration and extensive intercity backbone routes, was uniquely positioned to serve the growing number of enterprises requiring dedicated fiber connections to hyperscale cloud on-ramps and edge computing facilities. Antin planned to accelerate network expansion into underserved enterprise markets in Germany and France, where fiber penetration rates remained significantly below those in the more mature Dutch and Belgian markets.

The deal was financed through a combination of equity from Antin's latest flagship fund and non-recourse project finance debt, with leverage levels consistent with investment-grade infrastructure assets. Antin's infrastructure investment team brought substantial experience in managing and scaling digital infrastructure platforms, having previously executed successful investments in data centers, tower companies, and broadband networks across Europe. Market analysts viewed the transaction as a benchmark deal for European fiber valuations, with the implied enterprise value representing approximately 18 times Eurofiber's projected forward EBITDA.
