The Qatar Investment Authority and Vestas Wind Systems announced in November 2025 the formation of a EUR 5.5 billion (approximately $6.0 billion) joint venture to acquire and develop a portfolio of offshore wind assets across the North Sea and Baltic Sea. The JV combines QIA's sovereign capital and long-term investment horizon with Vestas' technical expertise in wind turbine technology, project development, and offshore operations. The partnership targets a portfolio of five offshore wind farms totaling approximately 4.8 GW of installed and under-development capacity across Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Denmark.

The transaction represents a significant strategic pivot for QIA, which has been systematically diversifying Qatar's wealth away from hydrocarbon dependency by investing in renewable energy infrastructure. For Vestas, the joint venture provides a captive capital partner to support the company's growing role as an integrated offshore wind solutions provider, extending beyond turbine manufacturing into project ownership and long-term asset management. The portfolio includes two operational wind farms in the German North Sea, one under construction in the Dutch North Sea, and two late-stage development projects in the Polish and Danish Baltic Sea.

Revenue certainty for the portfolio is underpinned by a combination of government-backed contracts for difference (CfDs), long-term corporate power purchase agreements, and regulated feed-in tariffs, providing inflation-linked cash flows over 20-25 year periods. The JV partners committed to investing an additional EUR 2 billion in next-generation 15+ MW turbine technology and floating foundation R&D, positioning the platform to participate in the next wave of European offshore wind development in deeper waters. Closing of the initial portfolio acquisition is expected in the first half of 2026, subject to competition approvals and foreign investment screening in each jurisdiction.
