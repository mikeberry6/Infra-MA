I Squared Capital announced in July 2025 the acquisition of Phoenix Tower International's Latin American operations for $2.8 billion, encompassing a portfolio of approximately 18,000 telecommunications towers across six countries. The transaction ranks among the largest digital infrastructure investments in Latin American history and reflects the accelerating wave of tower consolidation across the region as mobile network operators and independent tower companies seek scale to support 4G expansion and early 5G network deployments.

The portfolio spans Colombia (the largest market with approximately 6,500 towers), Ecuador, Peru, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and Bolivia, serving all major mobile network operators in each market through long-term lease agreements. Latin America's wireless tower sector has benefited from strong structural tailwinds, including rising smartphone penetration, growth in mobile data consumption averaging 30-40% annually, and the ongoing build-out of 4G LTE coverage in secondary and tertiary cities. The region's tower co-location rates remain significantly below North American and European levels, presenting substantial organic growth opportunities.

I Squared Capital plans to invest an additional $500 million in new tower construction and build-to-suit programs over the next five years, targeting underserved rural and suburban areas where mobile coverage gaps persist. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals in each of the six operating countries, with closing anticipated by the end of 2025. I Squared will retain the existing local management teams and operational platforms in each market, while deploying its proprietary digital infrastructure analytics tools to optimize site acquisition, co-location marketing, and preventive maintenance across the portfolio.
