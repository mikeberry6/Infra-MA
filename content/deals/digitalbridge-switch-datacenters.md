DigitalBridge Group finalized its landmark $11 billion take-private acquisition of Switch, Inc., consolidating one of North America's most advanced hyperscale data center platforms under private ownership. The transaction, which included the assumption of existing debt, represented one of the largest data center deals in history and underscored the explosive demand for digital infrastructure driven by cloud computing, artificial intelligence workloads, and enterprise digital transformation. Switch's campuses, renowned for their proprietary cooling technology and 100% renewable energy commitments, were highly sought after by multiple bidders before DigitalBridge prevailed.

The acquisition gave DigitalBridge control of approximately 5.5 million square feet of operating data center capacity spread across four major U.S. markets, with substantial land reserves for future expansion. Switch's Las Vegas campus alone represents one of the largest contiguous data center developments in the world, serving hyperscale cloud providers, Fortune 500 enterprises, and government agencies. The deal significantly expanded DigitalBridge's portfolio company, Vantage Data Centers, positioning the combined platform to compete with industry leaders such as Equinix and Digital Realty.

Industry analysts noted that the transaction reflected the premium valuations being placed on high-quality digital infrastructure assets, with the deal pricing Switch at approximately 28 times its adjusted EBITDA. The acquisition also highlighted the growing convergence between traditional infrastructure investing and technology, as institutional investors increasingly view data centers as essential utilities rather than speculative technology plays.
