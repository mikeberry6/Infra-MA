EQT has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a portfolio of data center assets from DigitalBridge, marking one of the largest pure-play data center transactions in recent years.

## Strategic Rationale

The transaction capitalizes on surging demand for data center capacity driven by artificial intelligence workloads and enterprise cloud migration. The portfolio's strategic locations in major interconnection hubs provide access to key cloud on-ramps and enterprise customers.

## Key Considerations

- Existing long-term contracts with hyperscale cloud providers and large enterprise tenants
- Expansion capacity of approximately 200 MW across multiple sites
- Transaction subject to customary regulatory approvals
