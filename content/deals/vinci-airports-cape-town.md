VINCI Airports announced in December 2025 that it had been awarded a 30-year concession to operate, maintain, and expand Cape Town International Airport, Africa's second-busiest airport by passenger throughput, in a deal valued at approximately ZAR 18 billion ($1.0 billion). The concession, awarded following a competitive bidding process managed by Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) and the South African National Treasury, represented VINCI Airports' first major entry into the African aviation market and extended the company's global network to 14 countries. The concession terms required VINCI to undertake significant capital investments in terminal modernization, runway rehabilitation, and capacity expansion to accommodate projected passenger growth.

Cape Town International Airport handled approximately 12 million passengers annually, serving as the primary gateway for the Western Cape's tourism industry, one of South Africa's most important economic sectors. The airport's traffic had demonstrated strong recovery following the pandemic, with international passenger numbers driven by the city's growing popularity as a long-haul leisure destination and its emergence as a regional hub for technology and financial services companies. VINCI's operational plan envisioned expanding annual passenger capacity to 18 million within the first decade of the concession through terminal reconfiguration, new boarding gates, and enhanced landside facilities.

The concession structure included revenue-sharing mechanisms with ACSA, performance-based quality benchmarks, and requirements for local procurement and workforce development. VINCI committed to investing approximately ZAR 8 billion in capital improvements over the first 15 years and pledged to achieve carbon-neutral airport operations by 2035, consistent with its global sustainability commitments. The South African government viewed the transaction as a landmark public-private partnership that would bring international operational expertise and private capital to modernize critical national transport infrastructure while maintaining public oversight and regulatory control.
