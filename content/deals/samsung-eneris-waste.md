Samsung Engineering announced in May 2025 its EUR 1.9 billion (approximately $2.1 billion) acquisition of the Eneris Group waste-to-energy platform from Penta Investments, marking the South Korean company's most ambitious international expansion into environmental infrastructure. The Eneris platform comprises 12 thermal waste treatment facilities across Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Romania, with combined annual processing capacity of approximately 3.5 million tonnes. The deal also includes associated district heating networks that supply thermal energy to municipal customers, landfill gas capture installations, and advanced material recycling operations.

The acquisition reflects Samsung Engineering's strategic pivot toward environmental and circular economy infrastructure, a sector experiencing strong growth across Central and Eastern Europe as EU waste management directives mandate steep reductions in landfill disposal. The EU's revised Waste Framework Directive requires member states to reduce landfill disposal to less than 10% of municipal waste by 2035, creating significant demand for waste-to-energy capacity in countries that currently landfill 40-60% of their waste. Eneris's facilities are positioned to benefit from this structural tailwind, with long-term municipal waste supply agreements and regulated gate fees providing revenue predictability.

Samsung plans to integrate its proprietary combustion optimization and emissions control technologies into the Eneris platform to improve energy recovery efficiency and reduce particulate and NOx emissions below current regulatory thresholds. The company also committed to investing an additional EUR 400 million in new waste-to-energy capacity and carbon capture pilot projects at select facilities. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals from competition authorities in each operating country and review under the EU's foreign direct investment screening framework, with closing expected by late 2025.
