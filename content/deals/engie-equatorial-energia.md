Engie Brasil Energia finalized its landmark acquisition of Equatorial Energia in January 2024, in a transaction valued at approximately BRL 30 billion (roughly $6.0 billion at prevailing exchange rates). The deal combined Engie's leading position in power generation with Equatorial's extensive regulated distribution network, creating one of the most vertically integrated energy companies in Latin America. The acquisition was funded through a combination of new equity issuance, long-term BRL-denominated debt, and support from parent company Engie SA.

The strategic rationale centered on Brazil's evolving energy landscape, where distribution companies are increasingly pivotal as the country transitions toward a more decentralized and renewable-heavy grid. Equatorial's concessions in the rapidly developing northern and northeastern states of Brazil offered attractive long-term growth potential, with electricity demand in these regions projected to outpace the national average driven by population growth, urbanization, and industrial expansion.

The transaction received approval from Brazil's electricity regulator ANEEL and the antitrust authority CADE, subject to conditions including commitments to maintain investment levels in distribution network upgrades and rural electrification programs. Engie committed to preserving Equatorial's operational management team and governance structure during a transition period, recognizing the company's strong track record of improving distribution efficiency and reducing technical losses across its concession areas.
