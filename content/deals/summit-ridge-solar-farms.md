Summit Ridge Energy closed a $1.3 billion acquisition of 185 operational community solar installations from SunVest Solar Holdings, reinforcing its dominant position as the largest community solar owner and operator in the United States. The portfolio, spanning 1.4 GW of generation capacity across Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Minnesota, served over 95,000 active residential and commercial subscribers who received credits on their electricity bills for their share of solar production without needing to install panels on their own properties. The transaction was the largest pure-play community solar deal to date and reflected growing institutional investor confidence in the distributed solar segment.

Community solar had emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. renewable energy market, driven by supportive state-level policies, federal tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, and strong consumer demand from households and businesses unable to host rooftop solar systems. The acquired portfolio benefited from long-term subscriber agreements and net metering or community solar credit programs in each operating state, providing stable, predictable cash flows. Summit Ridge planned to leverage its proprietary subscriber management platform to improve customer retention and reduce churn rates across the newly acquired assets, which had historically operated under a less sophisticated subscriber acquisition framework.

The acquisition also included a development pipeline of approximately 500 MW of additional community solar projects in various stages of permitting across New Jersey, Connecticut, and Colorado, where recently enacted community solar legislation was creating new market opportunities. Summit Ridge indicated that it expected to bring the majority of the pipeline projects to commercial operation within 24 months, supported by its established relationships with engineering, procurement, and construction contractors and its proven project financing capabilities.
