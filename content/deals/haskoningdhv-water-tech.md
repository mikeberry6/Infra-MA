Royal HaskoningDHV completed its EUR 850 million (approximately $0.9 billion) acquisition of WaterTech Solutions, a German water technology specialist, in a deal that transformed the Dutch engineering consultancy into a vertically integrated water infrastructure platform. The transaction brought together HaskoningDHV's century-long expertise in water engineering and project management with WaterTech's proprietary membrane filtration technology and operational capabilities, creating a differentiated offering for municipal and industrial water clients facing mounting pressure from aging infrastructure, climate change, and tightening regulatory standards across Europe.

WaterTech's portfolio included 14 operational desalination and advanced water treatment facilities across Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark, employing the company's proprietary low-energy reverse osmosis membranes that achieved industry-leading water recovery rates while consuming up to 30% less energy than conventional systems. Additionally, WaterTech's digital water management platform, a cloud-based SaaS solution used by over 200 municipal utilities, provided real-time monitoring of water quality, network pressure, and leakage detection, enabling utilities to reduce non-revenue water losses and optimize treatment processes. The combination of physical assets and digital capabilities positioned the merged entity to address the European water sector's estimated EUR 500 billion infrastructure investment gap.

The acquisition was funded through a combination of internal resources and a new sustainability-linked credit facility, with interest rate margins tied to measurable improvements in water efficiency metrics across the combined portfolio. Industry experts viewed the deal as indicative of a broader trend toward convergence between traditional engineering consultancies and technology-enabled infrastructure operators, as water sector participants increasingly recognized that digital tools and advanced treatment technologies were essential to meeting the continent's water security challenges.
