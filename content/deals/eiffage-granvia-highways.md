Eiffage S.A. closed its EUR 2.3 billion (approximately $2.5 billion) acquisition of Granvia Concessions, securing a portfolio of five toll highway concessions spanning approximately 680 kilometers across Spain and Portugal. The transaction reinforced Eiffage's position as one of Europe's premier concession operators and significantly expanded its Iberian footprint, complementing its existing French motorway operations through its APRR subsidiary, one of the largest toll road operators in France. The Granvia portfolio's long remaining concession lives, ranging from 18 to 35 years, provided attractive visibility on future cash flows and aligned with Eiffage's strategy of building a diversified, long-duration infrastructure portfolio.

The crown jewel of the portfolio was a segment of the AP-7 Mediterranean corridor, one of Spain's busiest motorways connecting Barcelona to the Costa del Sol, which benefited from robust traffic volumes driven by both commercial freight and tourism. The remaining four concessions included intercity highways in central Spain and a cross-border route linking northern Portugal to the Spanish motorway network. All five concessions featured inflation-linked toll adjustment mechanisms, providing a natural hedge against rising costs and supporting stable real returns for investors. Traffic volumes across the portfolio had recovered to pre-pandemic levels by early 2023, with several routes exceeding historical highs.

The deal was financed through a combination of Eiffage corporate debt, project-level non-recourse financing, and internal cash generation, maintaining the company's investment-grade credit profile. Market participants noted that the transaction reflected the continued strong appetite among European concession operators for high-quality toll road assets, particularly those with long residual lives and predictable traffic patterns in mature markets.
