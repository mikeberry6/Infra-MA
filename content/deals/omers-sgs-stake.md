OMERS Infrastructure announced its acquisition of a strategic stake in SGS SA, the Geneva-headquartered global leader in testing, inspection, and certification services, in a transaction valued at approximately CHF 5.2 billion. The investment represents one of the largest single commitments in OMERS Infrastructure's history and marks a significant expansion of the pension fund's portfolio into essential services infrastructure. SGS operates a vast global network of over 2,600 offices and laboratories spanning more than 140 countries, providing mission-critical quality assurance, compliance testing, and certification services that underpin global trade, food safety, environmental protection, and industrial standards.

The deal was structured as a negotiated acquisition of a cornerstone shareholding from Groupe Bruxelles Lambert and other institutional shareholders, with OMERS securing governance rights commensurate with its investment size. OMERS Infrastructure identified SGS as a compelling infrastructure-adjacent investment due to the company's deeply embedded position in global supply chains, its highly recurring revenue model — approximately 80% of revenues are recurring or repeat in nature — and the structural growth tailwinds from increasing regulatory complexity, sustainability reporting mandates, and supply chain due diligence requirements across virtually every industry.

While the transaction awaits regulatory clearances in several jurisdictions including Switzerland, the EU, and certain emerging markets, it is expected to close within the year. OMERS has indicated it intends to be a long-term supportive shareholder, backing SGS management's strategy to accelerate digital transformation of inspection services, expand into high-growth sustainability and ESG assurance verticals, and pursue bolt-on acquisitions to consolidate a fragmented industry. The deal broadened the definition of what institutional investors classify as infrastructure, reflecting an ongoing evolution toward assets with infrastructure-like characteristics — essential services, high barriers to entry, and regulatory-driven demand.
