Mubadala Investment Company closed a $3.4 billion acquisition of deepwater pre-salt production assets from Petrobras in Brazil's prolific Santos Basin, marking one of the largest upstream energy transactions in Latin America in recent years. The deal was part of Petrobras's ongoing portfolio rationalization strategy, which aimed to concentrate resources on its most productive core assets while reducing leverage. For Mubadala, the acquisition represented a strategic expansion into one of the world's most attractive deepwater basins, where pre-salt reservoirs have consistently delivered high-quality, low-cost barrels.

The asset package included non-operated interests in multiple producing fields with combined output exceeding 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, along with substantial proved and probable reserves. The pre-salt formations, located beneath thick layers of salt deep beneath the Atlantic seabed, have transformed Brazil into one of the top oil-producing nations globally. Mubadala's petroleum and petrochemicals division, which already managed significant upstream assets across the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Russia, viewed the Brazilian assets as complementary to its existing portfolio and well-positioned to generate stable long-term cash flows.

The transaction required approval from Brazil's National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) and was subject to customary regulatory review processes. Analysts noted that the deal pricing implied a modest discount to comparable recent transactions in the basin, reflecting the non-operated nature of the interests and the complex fiscal regime governing Brazilian pre-salt production.
