The International Finance Corporation announced in April 2025 that it would lead a consortium to acquire a 60% equity stake in the Nairobi Expressway for $800 million, marking one of the most significant infrastructure transactions in East African history. The consortium includes African institutional investors, European development finance institutions, and a specialized infrastructure fund focused on emerging market transport assets. The deal represents a strategic refinancing of the expressway, which was originally built and operated by China Road and Bridge Corporation under a public-private partnership with the Kenyan government.

The 27-kilometer elevated toll road, which opened to traffic in 2022, connects Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Nairobi's western suburbs and the Kikuyu area, dramatically reducing commute times along one of the most congested corridors in Sub-Saharan Africa. Daily traffic volumes have exceeded initial projections, with the expressway serving over 50,000 vehicles per day during peak periods. Revenue is generated through electronic toll collection with dynamic pricing based on time of day and vehicle classification.

The transaction was structured to address longstanding concerns from Kenyan policymakers about the concentration of infrastructure ownership and to introduce institutional investors with long-term ESG mandates. The consortium committed to implementing a local workforce development program and improving the expressway's intermodal connectivity with planned bus rapid transit stations. Closing is contingent on approval from the Kenya National Highways Authority and clearance under Kenya's competition framework, with a target completion date in the third quarter of 2025.
