Temasek Holdings completed a $2.0 billion acquisition of a 12.5% equity stake in Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL), marking one of the largest foreign direct investments in India's renewable energy sector. The transaction, executed through a combination of secondary market purchases and a negotiated block trade, signaled renewed confidence from a major global institutional investor in the Adani Group's clean energy platform following a turbulent period triggered by short-seller allegations in early 2023. Temasek's investment was viewed as a validation of AGEL's operational track record and its ambitious growth trajectory targeting 45 GW of renewable capacity by 2030.

AGEL operated one of the world's largest renewable energy portfolios, with 10.9 GW of operational wind and solar capacity spread across multiple Indian states, supported by long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with state distribution utilities and central government entities. The company's development pipeline included over 20 GW of additional projects in various stages of permitting and construction, positioning it to play a central role in India's target of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel generation capacity by 2030. Temasek's investment provided AGEL with implicit endorsement from one of Asia's most respected institutional investors, potentially improving the company's access to international capital markets and lowering its cost of capital.

The deal included certain governance provisions giving Temasek board observer rights and information access, though the Singaporean investor would not take an active management role. Analysts noted that Temasek's entry price implied a significant discount to AGEL's pre-controversy trading levels while still reflecting a premium to the post-correction share price, suggesting that the investor secured favorable terms in exchange for providing a strong signal of institutional support at a critical juncture for the Adani Group.
