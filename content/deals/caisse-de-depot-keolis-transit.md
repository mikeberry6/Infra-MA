The Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec (CDPQ) had entered exclusive negotiations with SNCF Group to acquire the Keolis transit platform for approximately EUR 3.6 billion (roughly $3.9 billion), in what would have been one of the largest public transit infrastructure transactions in history. Keolis operates bus, tramway, metro, and commuter rail services across 13 countries, managing over 300 transit networks and serving approximately 3.4 billion passenger trips annually. The acquisition would have transformed CDPQ into one of the world's largest private owners of public transit infrastructure, complementing its existing investments including the REM automated light metro system in Montreal.

However, the transaction was terminated in April 2024 following significant opposition from the French government, which raised concerns about transferring ownership of a strategically important domestic transit operator to a foreign institutional investor. France's foreign investment screening authority indicated it would impose conditions that CDPQ and SNCF considered commercially unworkable, including restrictions on governance changes, workforce reductions, and route rationalization across Keolis's extensive French operations. Additional regulatory complications arose in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Sweden, where transit concession authorities flagged change-of-control provisions that would have required individual renegotiation of dozens of franchise agreements.

The deal's collapse highlighted the growing tension between institutional investors' appetite for stable, long-duration social infrastructure assets and the political sensitivity surrounding foreign ownership of public transit services. SNCF subsequently announced it would explore alternative strategic options for Keolis, including a potential partial IPO or strategic partnership with another European transport operator. CDPQ stated it remained committed to the global transit infrastructure sector and would continue to evaluate opportunities that offered a clearer regulatory and political pathway to completion.
