Meridiam finalized its $1.1 billion acquisition of a 35-year concession to operate the main container terminal at the Port of Dakar in December 2023. The deal was structured as a concession agreement with the Autonomous Port of Dakar (PAD), with Meridiam assuming responsibility for terminal operations, capital investment in expansion, and modernization of cargo handling equipment. The transaction followed a competitive tender process in which Meridiam outbid several global port operators, leveraging its extensive experience in African infrastructure concessions.

The Port of Dakar is the primary maritime gateway for Senegal and serves as a key transshipment hub for landlocked West African nations including Mali and Burkina Faso. Current throughput of approximately 650,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) is constrained by aging infrastructure and limited berth depth, which Meridiam plans to address through a phased investment program. The expansion plan includes deepening the approach channel to accommodate post-Panamax vessels, constructing a new berth with modern ship-to-shore gantry cranes, and implementing a digital terminal operating system to improve throughput efficiency.

The concession is underpinned by favorable macroeconomic dynamics, with West Africa's containerized trade volumes projected to grow at 6-8% annually over the next decade driven by population growth, urbanization, and increasing regional trade integration under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Meridiam committed to meeting stringent environmental and social standards, including electrification of yard equipment, installation of shore power facilities, and creation of a vocational training program for Senegalese port workers.
