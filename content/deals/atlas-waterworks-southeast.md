The Atlas Utilities Consortium, a joint venture of two major Canadian pension funds, has announced a definitive agreement to acquire Southeast WaterWorks Holdings in a take-private transaction valued at $8.6 billion including net debt. The offer represents a 32% premium to the undisturbed share price.

## Strategic Rationale

The acquisition targets one of the fastest-growing population corridors in the United States, where aging water infrastructure and increasing regulatory standards are driving significant capital investment needs. The regulated nature of the business provides inflation-linked, predictable returns well suited to pension fund liabilities.

## Key Considerations

- Rate base of approximately $5.2 billion with an approved capital expenditure plan of $3.8 billion through 2029
- Constructive regulatory environment across all four state jurisdictions
- Organic customer growth averaging 2.3% annually over the past five years
- Transaction requires approval from state public utility commissions in Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, and South Carolina, as well as CFIUS review
- Expected closing in Q2 2025
