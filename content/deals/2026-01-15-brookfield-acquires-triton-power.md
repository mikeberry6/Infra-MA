## Transaction Overview

Brookfield Asset Management has agreed to acquire Triton Power, a portfolio of natural gas-fired power generation assets totaling approximately 5.5 GW of capacity, from Energy Capital Partners for approximately $2.1 billion. The transaction is expected to close in Q2 2026, subject to customary regulatory approvals including FERC authorization.

## Asset Profile

Triton Power operates a fleet of natural gas-fired generation facilities across the PJM and ERCOT markets in the United States. The portfolio comprises predominantly combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants with an average age under 15 years. Key attributes include contracted revenue streams, proximity to major load centers, and dual-fuel capability at select facilities.

## Strategic Rationale

For Brookfield, this acquisition deepens its exposure to dispatchable thermal generation — a segment the firm views as critical to grid reliability during the energy transition. Gas-fired peaking and intermediate capacity is increasingly valued as renewable penetration rises and baseload retirements accelerate. Brookfield's infrastructure franchise has historically targeted assets with essential-service characteristics and stable cash flows.

## Market Context

The transaction reflects continued strong investor appetite for gas-fired generation assets in North America, driven by data center demand growth and increasing recognition of the role of gas as a transition fuel. Comparable recent transactions include KKR's acquisition of ContourGlobal and Blackstone's investment in Invenergy's gas portfolio, both at similar EV/EBITDA multiples.

## Key Considerations

- FERC and state-level regulatory approvals required
- Environmental permitting and emissions compliance in PJM and ERCOT
- Potential for capacity market reforms affecting long-term revenue visibility
- Integration with Brookfield's existing North American power portfolio
