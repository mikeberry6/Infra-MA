Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec completed its acquisition of a strategic equity stake in Auckland International Airport, New Zealand's largest and busiest airport, in a transaction valued at approximately NZD 2.3 billion. The investment gave CDPQ meaningful exposure to a high-quality aviation infrastructure asset benefiting from a robust post-pandemic recovery in international passenger volumes, particularly on long-haul routes connecting New Zealand with Asia, North America, and Europe. Auckland Airport handles the vast majority of New Zealand's international air traffic and serves as the critical gateway for the country's tourism-dependent economy.

The acquisition was structured through a combination of on-market share purchases and negotiated block trades with existing institutional shareholders. CDPQ's stake, while below the threshold requiring Overseas Investment Office approval for a change of control, was sufficiently large to afford the fund significant influence over corporate governance and capital allocation. Auckland Airport has been undertaking a multi-billion-dollar terminal expansion and infrastructure upgrade program, creating an attractive entry point for a long-term investor willing to fund growth capital expenditure in exchange for enhanced future cash flows.

For CDPQ, the investment deepened its already substantial global airports portfolio, which includes stakes in airports across Europe and Latin America. The fund's infrastructure team identified Auckland Airport as a compelling opportunity given its monopoly position in an island nation with no viable surface transport alternatives for international travel, its strong aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenue streams, and its significant land bank available for commercial and logistics development. The deal reflected continued strong institutional appetite for core airport assets as passenger traffic globally returned to and in many markets exceeded pre-pandemic levels.
