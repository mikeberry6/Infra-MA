GIC Private Limited, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, closed a $3.9 billion joint venture with Equinix to develop, own, and operate a portfolio of xScale hyperscale data centers across the Asia-Pacific region. The joint venture, in which GIC holds an 80% equity interest and Equinix retains the remaining 20% along with operational management responsibilities, targets the development of over 250 megawatts of data center capacity across facilities in Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul, and Sydney. The xScale program is Equinix's purpose-built hyperscale offering, designed to complement its core retail colocation business by providing large-format deployments tailored to the needs of major cloud service providers, AI companies, and technology platforms.

The partnership extended a successful collaboration model that Equinix had pioneered with GIC and other sovereign wealth and pension fund investors in previous xScale joint ventures in Europe and North America. For GIC, the structure offered direct exposure to high-growth digital infrastructure in Asia-Pacific's most dynamic markets, with the benefit of Equinix's unmatched operational expertise, customer relationships, and global interconnection platform. The Asia-Pacific region has experienced some of the fastest data center demand growth globally, driven by rapid cloud adoption across enterprise segments, the buildout of AI training and inference infrastructure, and the digital transformation of traditional industries.

The joint venture's initial portfolio includes sites in several of the most supply-constrained data center markets in the Asia-Pacific region, where securing adequate power supply, land, and connectivity has become increasingly challenging. GIC's commitment of substantial long-term capital provided Equinix with the financial flexibility to pursue development without diluting its REIT balance sheet, while GIC gained access to a pipeline of pre-leased and development-stage assets with strong visibility on future cash flows. The deal reinforced the growing role of sovereign wealth funds as critical capital partners for digital infrastructure platforms seeking to scale rapidly in response to the AI-driven demand supercycle.
