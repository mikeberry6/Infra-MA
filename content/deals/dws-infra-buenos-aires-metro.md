DWS Infrastructure announced in September 2023 the termination of its planned $1.6 billion acquisition of the Buenos Aires metro (Subte) concession from Metrovías S.A., citing deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment in Argentina. The transaction, which had been under negotiation since early 2023, would have given DWS control of a 20-year concession to operate the Argentine capital's extensive metro system, comprising six lines, 90 stations, and a fleet of over 700 railcars serving approximately 1.3 million daily passengers. The deal's collapse underscored the difficulties international investors face when attempting to deploy capital in infrastructure assets in economically volatile emerging markets.

The primary factors behind the termination included Argentina's persistent foreign exchange controls, which would have complicated the repatriation of dividends and management fees, and escalating inflation that eroded the real value of the peso-denominated fare revenues. Additionally, the Argentine government's practice of controlling metro fares for political reasons had historically compressed the concession's operating margins, making it difficult for DWS to model reliable long-term returns. The peso had depreciated by over 50% against the U.S. dollar during the negotiation period, fundamentally altering the economics of the transaction from the perspective of a euro-denominated infrastructure fund.

Despite the failed transaction, DWS maintained its interest in Latin American infrastructure, noting that the region's significant infrastructure deficit and growing population presented compelling long-term investment opportunities in markets with more stable macroeconomic frameworks. Metrovías S.A. continued to operate the metro system under its existing concession terms and subsequently entered into discussions with domestic investors and development finance institutions about potential recapitalization structures that would better accommodate the unique risks of Argentine infrastructure investment.
