ABP, one of the world's largest pension funds, announced a EUR 6.2 billion (approximately $6.8 billion) agreement to acquire a cluster of three operational offshore wind farms in the North Sea from Ørsted, the Danish renewable energy major. The transaction represented one of the largest single renewable energy investments ever undertaken by a pension fund and reflected ABP's strategic commitment to building a portfolio of long-duration, inflation-protected infrastructure assets that align with its net-zero investment targets. The wind farms, with a combined installed capacity of 2.4 GW, generated sufficient clean electricity to power approximately 2.8 million European households and avoided an estimated 4.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.

The cluster comprised three wind farms located in the Dutch and German exclusive economic zones of the North Sea, utilizing state-of-the-art turbine technology from leading manufacturers. The assets were fully operational, with track records spanning three to seven years, and benefited from a combination of government-backed contracts for difference (CfDs) and merchant power price exposure in the highly liquid Northwest European electricity market. The CfD contracts provided revenue certainty for a significant portion of each wind farm's output over terms extending 15 to 20 years, while the merchant exposure offered potential upside from elevated European power prices driven by the ongoing energy transition and the displacement of natural gas generation.

For Ørsted, the sale represented an asset recycling strategy, freeing up capital to fund its extensive pipeline of offshore wind development projects across Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific, which exceeded 30 GW in total. The transaction included operational and maintenance agreements under which Ørsted would continue to manage the wind farms for a transitional period, ensuring continuity of operations while ABP built internal capabilities to oversee the assets. ABP indicated that the acquisition would be held through its infrastructure investment division and was expected to generate stable, long-term returns consistent with the fund's actuarial requirements for its 3 million active and retired members.
