Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan completed its AUD 2.5 billion (approximately $1.7 billion) acquisition of the Sydney Desalination Plant in July 2024, securing one of Australia's most strategically important water infrastructure assets. The desalination plant, located at Kurnell on the southern shore of Botany Bay, has a production capacity of 250 megaliters per day and can supply up to 15% of greater Sydney's drinking water needs. The facility was originally constructed between 2007 and 2010 in response to the severe Millennium Drought that depleted Sydney's dam reserves to critically low levels.

The acquisition was structured around the plant's existing availability-based payment model, under which Sydney Water Corporation makes regular payments to the facility operator regardless of whether the plant is actively producing water. This structure provides the asset with utility-like revenue certainty, as payments are contractually guaranteed over the remaining concession period and are indexed to Australian CPI. The plant is maintained in a state of operational readiness and can ramp to full production within 48 hours of activation, providing a critical buffer against drought conditions.

OTPP's investment thesis centered on the increasing value of climate-resilient water infrastructure in the context of Australia's growing population and the rising frequency and severity of drought events linked to climate change. The plant's environmental credentials were a key differentiator, as it operates using 100% renewable energy sourced through a dedicated power purchase agreement with the Capital Wind Farm. OTPP plans to explore expansion opportunities, including a potential capacity upgrade to 500 megaliters per day, which has been identified in the NSW government's long-term metropolitan water strategy.
