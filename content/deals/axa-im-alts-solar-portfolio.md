AXA IM Alts closed its $2.2 billion acquisition of a 3.2 GW utility-scale solar portfolio from SunPower Corporation in December 2024, marking one of the largest renewable energy asset transactions in North America that year. The portfolio comprises 42 operating solar photovoltaic plants distributed across four states in the US Sun Belt, with the largest concentration in Texas (1.4 GW) and California (0.9 GW). Each facility is supported by long-term power purchase agreements with investment-grade utility and corporate offtakers, providing highly predictable revenue streams.

The transaction aligned with AXA IM Alts' strategy of acquiring operating renewable energy assets with de-risked cash flow profiles, avoiding construction and development risk while gaining exposure to the structural growth in US clean energy demand. The portfolio benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act's production tax credits and the broader policy tailwinds supporting solar deployment in the United States. Average remaining PPA tenor across the portfolio is approximately 18 years, with built-in escalators linked to CPI.

The deal was financed through a combination of equity from AXA IM Alts' Infrastructure Fund VI and non-recourse project finance debt provided by a syndicate of North American and European lenders. AXA engaged a specialized renewable energy asset manager to oversee operations and maintenance, with performance optimization initiatives expected to increase annual energy production by 3-5% through panel cleaning protocols, inverter upgrades, and vegetation management improvements. The portfolio's diversified geographic footprint provides natural hedging against localized weather variability and curtailment risk.
