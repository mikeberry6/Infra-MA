KKR's acquisition of FiberCop, Telecom Italia's fixed-line network infrastructure business, marked a watershed moment for European digital infrastructure investment. The deal, valued at approximately EUR 18.8 billion (roughly $20.5 billion), gave KKR control of Italy's national broadband backbone — a network spanning hundreds of thousands of kilometers of fiber and copper lines connecting homes, businesses, and public institutions across the country. The Italian government, through the Ministry of Economy and Finance, retained a meaningful co-investment stake, reflecting the strategic importance of the asset to national digital sovereignty.

The transaction was the culmination of years of deliberation within TIM and Italian policymaking circles about the optimal ownership structure for the country's telecoms infrastructure. By separating NetCo (the network) from ServCo (the retail and enterprise services business), TIM was able to dramatically reduce its debt burden, which had weighed on the company's share price for over a decade. For KKR, the deal provided access to a regulated, monopoly-like asset with long-duration contracted revenues and a substantial runway for fiber-to-the-home upgrades as Italy pursues EU-funded digitalization targets.

Regulatory approval came from both the European Commission and Italy's Golden Power authority, which imposed conditions to ensure open-access wholesale terms and continued investment in underserved rural areas. The deal is expected to catalyze further network separation transactions across Europe, as incumbent telcos in Germany, France, and Spain evaluate similar structural options. KKR plans to invest heavily in accelerating fiber rollout, targeting near-universal FTTH coverage within the decade as part of Italy's broader National Recovery and Resilience Plan.
