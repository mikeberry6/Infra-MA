PSP Investments completed its acquisition of Forth Ports Limited, one of the United Kingdom's largest and most diversified port groups, in a transaction valued at approximately GBP 1.6 billion. The acquisition transferred ownership of seven commercial ports from Arcus Infrastructure Partners, which had held and developed the business for over a decade. Forth Ports' flagship asset is the Port of Tilbury on the Thames Estuary, which serves as a critical logistics gateway for London and southeast England. The portfolio also includes the Port of Grangemouth — Scotland's largest container terminal — along with ports in Dundee, Leith, Rosyth, Burntisland, and Methil, collectively handling approximately 30 million tonnes of cargo annually.

The deal was strategically attractive to PSP Investments for several reasons. UK ports operate under a favorable regulatory framework as trust or private ports with significant pricing flexibility and no formal tariff regulation, providing operators with the ability to invest in capacity and capture returns commensurate with risk. Forth Ports had invested heavily in expanding and modernizing its facilities, including the development of Tilbury2 — a major new port terminal on the north bank of the Thames purpose-built for construction materials, bulk goods, and roll-on/roll-off ferry traffic. The group was also positioning its Scottish ports as servicing hubs for the rapidly growing North Sea offshore wind industry, creating a compelling growth angle alongside the stable base cargo business.

For Arcus, the sale represented a highly successful realization of an investment made during the early years of the European infrastructure fund market. Under Arcus's ownership, Forth Ports expanded its cargo throughput, diversified its revenue base, and invested in new terminal capacity that positioned the business for long-term growth. PSP Investments, with its permanent capital base and long-duration investment horizon, was well-positioned to continue this development trajectory, particularly as the UK government prioritized port infrastructure investment as part of its green industrial strategy and freeport initiative.
