Canada Pension Plan Investment Board completed its acquisition of Signature Aviation in a deal valued at $4.7 billion, securing ownership of the world's premier fixed-base operator network. Signature operates over 200 FBO locations at major airports across North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region, providing essential ground services — including fueling, hangarage, passenger lounges, and maintenance coordination — to private, business, and general aviation customers. The acquisition positioned CPPIB at the center of a structural growth story in business aviation, which has seen sustained demand increases following the pandemic-driven shift in corporate travel preferences.

The deal represented a secondary buyout, with the selling consortium having originally taken Signature private in a competitive process that attracted widespread interest from infrastructure and private equity investors. CPPIB's willingness to pay a premium for the asset reflected the fund's conviction in the durability of FBO cash flows, which benefit from long-term airport leases, limited competition at capacity-constrained airports, and high switching costs for aviation operators. Signature's dominant market share — roughly three times larger than its nearest competitor — provides meaningful pricing power and operational scale advantages.

CPPIB signaled its intention to pursue continued expansion of the Signature network through both organic development of new FBO facilities at underserved airports and selective bolt-on acquisitions of independent operators. The fund also identified opportunities to invest in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) infrastructure at Signature locations, aligning the platform with growing regulatory and corporate mandates for aviation decarbonization. The transaction highlighted the increasing appetite among Canada's major pension funds for transport infrastructure assets with embedded growth optionality.
