Ares Management, through its dedicated infrastructure platform InfraBridge, completed the acquisition of a portfolio of approximately 21,000 telecommunications towers from Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison for $1.8 billion. The transaction was structured as a sale-and-leaseback arrangement, allowing Indosat to monetize its passive infrastructure while retaining guaranteed access to the towers through a long-term master lease agreement spanning 12 years with renewal options.

The deal represented one of the largest digital infrastructure transactions in Southeast Asia during 2023, reflecting the accelerating trend of mobile network operators divesting tower assets to unlock capital for 5G network rollouts. Indonesia's rapidly growing digital economy, with over 200 million mobile internet users, made the portfolio particularly attractive for infrastructure investors seeking stable, inflation-linked cash flows in high-growth markets.

The acquisition underscored InfraBridge's strategy of targeting mission-critical digital infrastructure assets in markets with strong demographic tailwinds. The portfolio's geographic diversification across Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan provided exposure to Indonesia's most economically dynamic regions. Regulatory approval from the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Informatics was secured ahead of the August 2023 closing, with the new tower company expected to pursue co-location opportunities to drive organic growth.
