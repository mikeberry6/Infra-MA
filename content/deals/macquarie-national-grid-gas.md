A consortium led by Macquarie Asset Management completed its acquisition of National Grid's gas distribution business in a transaction valued at approximately GBP 9.6 billion, making it one of the largest infrastructure deals in UK history. The acquired network spans over 80,000 kilometers of pipeline and serves roughly 11 million connected premises across central and southern England. The consortium included British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) and several other long-term institutional investors, reflecting the asset's appeal to pension funds and sovereign wealth vehicles seeking stable, regulated returns.

The deal represented a strategic pivot for National Grid, which elected to divest its gas distribution operations to concentrate capital and management attention on electricity transmission — a segment poised for dramatic growth as the UK pursues its legally binding net-zero emissions target by 2050. The proceeds allowed National Grid to fund a multi-billion-pound investment program in new high-voltage transmission lines, interconnectors, and grid reinforcement needed to accommodate rapidly expanding offshore wind capacity and the electrification of transport and heating.

For Macquarie, the acquisition fit squarely within its established playbook of acquiring regulated utility networks and driving operational improvements over long holding periods. The consortium outlined plans to invest in the network's hydrogen readiness, funding trials to blend and eventually transport hydrogen through existing gas pipelines as part of the UK government's hydrogen strategy. While the long-term future of the gas distribution network is subject to policy uncertainty around heat decarbonization pathways, the regulated asset base provides inflation-linked revenue protection and a multi-decade transition timeline that aligns well with the patient capital horizons of the consortium's investors.
