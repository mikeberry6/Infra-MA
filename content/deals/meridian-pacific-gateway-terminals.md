Meridian Infrastructure Partners has agreed to acquire Pacific Gateway Terminals, a portfolio of four container terminal concessions across Asia-Pacific, from Vanguard Port Holdings. The transaction values the business at approximately $4.1 billion including assumed debt.

## Strategic Rationale

The acquisition expands Meridian's presence in the Asia-Pacific logistics corridor, a region experiencing rapid trade growth driven by supply chain diversification away from single-country dependence. The four terminals are positioned along key intra-Asia shipping routes and serve as critical nodes in regional supply chains.

## Key Considerations

- Average remaining concession life of 28 years across the portfolio
- Revenue is 70% contracted with major global shipping lines under take-or-pay arrangements
- Expansion capacity at the Brisbane and Ho Chi Minh City facilities could add 3 million TEUs of additional throughput
- Transaction is subject to regulatory approval from competition authorities in Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines
