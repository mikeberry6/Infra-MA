Brookfield Asset Management, in partnership with EIG Global Energy Partners, completed its acquisition of Origin Energy in a transaction that ranks among the largest infrastructure deals in Australian history. The consortium structured the deal to split Origin's businesses, with Brookfield taking control of the energy retail and generation arm — branded as Origin Energy — while EIG acquired Origin's prized 27.5% stake in Australia Pacific LNG, one of the country's most significant liquefied natural gas export ventures.

The acquisition reflected Brookfield's conviction that Australia's energy transition presents a generational investment opportunity. Origin's retail platform, serving roughly 4.5 million customer accounts, provides a stable cash-flow base, while its generation fleet — including the Eraring coal-fired power station, the country's largest — offers optionality for repowering with renewables and battery storage. Brookfield committed to an accelerated decarbonization plan, pledging to invest billions in new solar, wind, and storage capacity over the coming decade.

The deal faced extensive regulatory scrutiny from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Foreign Investment Review Board, as well as a contested shareholder vote that required multiple revised offers before clearing the 75% approval threshold. The final price represented a significant premium to Origin's pre-bid trading levels and underscored the intense global competition among infrastructure funds for high-quality energy transition assets in stable, developed-market jurisdictions.
