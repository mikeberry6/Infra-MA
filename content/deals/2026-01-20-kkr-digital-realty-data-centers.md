## Transaction Overview

KKR has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a portfolio of 12 data center facilities across Europe from Digital Realty Trust for approximately $3.4 billion. The portfolio spans key markets including Frankfurt, Amsterdam, London, and Dublin (FALD). The transaction represents one of the largest pure-play European data center acquisitions in recent years.

## Asset Profile

The portfolio comprises 12 carrier-neutral colocation facilities with an aggregate IT load capacity of approximately 180 MW. Facilities are located in Tier 1 European markets with strong connectivity ecosystems. Average remaining lease term across the portfolio exceeds 7 years, with a diversified tenant base of hyperscale and enterprise customers. Expansion capacity of approximately 60 MW is available across several sites.

## Strategic Rationale

KKR's infrastructure platform has identified European digital infrastructure as a core conviction theme. The acquisition provides immediate scale in the region's most supply-constrained data center markets, with embedded growth through expansion rights. For Digital Realty, the disposition is part of a broader capital recycling initiative to fund development of next-generation hyperscale campuses in North America and Asia.

## Market Context

European data center M&A remains highly competitive, driven by accelerating cloud adoption, AI workload growth, and limited power availability in key markets. Recent comparable transactions include Blackstone's acquisition of QTS Realty and EQT's investment in EdgeConneX. Cap rates for core European data centers have compressed to the 4.5-5.5% range, reflecting the asset class's infrastructure-like risk profile.

## Key Considerations

- EU competition review and national security screening in multiple jurisdictions
- Power procurement strategy amid rising European energy costs
- Tenant consent requirements for certain lease assignments
- Sustainability commitments including renewable energy sourcing and PUE targets
