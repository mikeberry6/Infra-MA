PGGM Investments completed its GBP 2.8 billion (approximately $3.5 billion) acquisition of an equity stake in Heathrow Airport Holdings from Ferrovial in August 2024, joining a distinguished shareholder register that includes some of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds and pension investors. The transaction was part of Ferrovial's gradual exit from its Heathrow position, which the Spanish infrastructure firm initiated in 2021 as it pivoted its airport strategy toward new concession opportunities and its growing US toll road portfolio.

London Heathrow Airport is the United Kingdom's busiest aviation hub and one of the world's most valuable airport infrastructure assets, handling approximately 82 million passengers in 2024 as post-pandemic international travel demand fully recovered. The airport's unique position as the primary long-haul gateway to the UK and Europe provides a structural competitive advantage, with over 60% of passengers traveling on intercontinental routes that generate higher aeronautical fees and premium retail spending. Heathrow's regulated asset base model, overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), provides investors with regulatory visibility into future tariff pathways and return on capital allowances.

PGGM's investment was driven by the airport's combination of resilient passenger demand, inflation-linked revenue growth, and the transformative potential of the planned third runway expansion, which received governmental reaffirmation following the Airports National Policy Statement. The expansion program, expected to increase annual capacity to over 130 million passengers, represents a multi-decade capital expenditure opportunity that will grow the regulated asset base and correspondingly increase allowed revenues. PGGM secured governance provisions including board observer rights and protective minority shareholder protections as part of the acquisition terms.
