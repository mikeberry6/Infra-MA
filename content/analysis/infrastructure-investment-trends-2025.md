The global infrastructure M&A market enters 2025 at an inflection point. After two years of rising interest rates tempered deal activity, a more accommodative monetary policy environment, combined with unprecedented capital formation in infrastructure funds, is setting the stage for a surge in transaction volume.

## The Capital Overhang

Infrastructure-focused funds raised a record $185 billion in 2024, bringing total dry powder to approximately $320 billion globally. This capital overhang is creating intense competition for quality assets, particularly in sectors with strong secular tailwinds.

> "We are seeing more capital chasing fewer high-quality assets than at any point in the last decade. Differentiation will come from operational expertise and creative deal structuring."

Fund managers are under increasing pressure to deploy capital within investment periods, which is expected to drive both deal volume and valuations higher through 2025.

## The AI Infrastructure Supercycle

Perhaps the most significant shift in the infrastructure landscape is the emergence of artificial intelligence as a primary demand driver. Data center capacity requirements are growing at 25-30% annually, driven by training and inference workloads for large language models and enterprise AI applications.

This demand is rippling across the infrastructure value chain:

- **Power generation** — AI data centers require reliable, large-scale power supply, driving investment in both renewable and gas-fired generation
- **Transmission infrastructure** — Grid constraints are becoming the primary bottleneck for data center development in key markets
- **Water infrastructure** — Cooling requirements for high-density computing are creating new demand for water treatment and recirculation systems
- **Fiber connectivity** — Dense interconnection between data center campuses is driving fiber investment

## Sovereign Capital's Growing Role

Sovereign wealth funds and national pension systems are allocating an increasing share of their portfolios to infrastructure. Several Gulf sovereign funds have announced target allocations of 15-20% to real assets, up from single digits a decade ago.

This trend is reshaping deal dynamics, as sovereign buyers bring patient capital, tolerance for complexity, and the ability to pursue larger transactions that exceed the capacity of traditional private equity funds.

## Regional Hotspots

### Asia-Pacific
The region continues to see strong activity in digital infrastructure, transport, and renewable energy. India's infrastructure modernization program and Southeast Asia's rapid urbanization are creating a deep pipeline of opportunities.

### Europe
The energy transition remains the dominant theme, with significant capital flowing into offshore wind, grid modernization, and hydrogen infrastructure. Regulatory certainty in Northern Europe is attracting premium valuations.

### Americas
Water and wastewater utilities in the United States represent a compelling opportunity set, given aging infrastructure, fragmented ownership, and supportive regulatory frameworks for consolidation.

## Outlook

We expect 2025 to see a meaningful increase in deal volume, driven by the capital deployment imperative, AI-related infrastructure demand, and a more favorable financing environment. Valuations will remain elevated for premium assets, but opportunities exist in mid-market transactions and emerging markets where competition is less intense.

The infrastructure asset class is evolving from a defensive, yield-oriented allocation to a dynamic sector offering both growth and income. Investors who can navigate this transition — combining operational expertise with creative capital solutions — will be best positioned to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.
