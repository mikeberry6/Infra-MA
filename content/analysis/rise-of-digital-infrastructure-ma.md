Digital infrastructure has rapidly evolved from a niche subsector to the single largest category of infrastructure M&A activity by deal value. In 2024 alone, digital infrastructure transactions accounted for over $120 billion in announced deal value globally — more than energy and transport combined.

## What's Driving the Surge

The confluence of several secular trends has created unprecedented demand for digital infrastructure assets:

**Artificial intelligence** is the most significant demand driver. Training frontier AI models requires massive computational capacity, and the inference workloads that follow are driving sustained demand for data center capacity. Major hyperscale cloud providers have collectively announced over $200 billion in planned data center capital expenditure through 2027.

**Enterprise cloud migration** continues to accelerate, with global cloud spending expected to exceed $1 trillion annually by 2026. This drives demand across the digital infrastructure stack — from core data centers to edge computing nodes to fiber connectivity.

**Data sovereignty requirements** are compelling organizations to build or lease capacity in specific jurisdictions, creating demand for localized digital infrastructure across previously underserved markets.

## The Deal Landscape

The digital infrastructure M&A market is characterized by large deal sizes and fierce competition. Recent notable transactions illustrate the scale of capital being deployed:

- Platform acquisitions of data center operators, with deal values frequently exceeding $5 billion
- Fiber network consolidation across European and Asian markets
- Tower transactions as mobile operators monetize passive infrastructure

> "Digital infrastructure is the backbone of the modern economy. The asset class offers inflation protection, contracted revenues, and exposure to structural growth — a rare combination in today's market."

## Valuation Dynamics

Digital infrastructure assets command premium valuations relative to traditional infrastructure sectors. Data centers are trading at 25-30x EBITDA for stabilized platforms with hyperscale customer relationships, compared to 12-15x for mature transport or utility assets.

These valuations reflect:
- High barriers to entry (power, land, permits, interconnection)
- Long-duration contracted revenue streams
- Embedded growth through expansion capacity
- Critical nature of the service provided

## Key Risks

Despite the compelling thesis, investors should be aware of several risks:

- **Technology obsolescence** — rapid evolution in computing architecture could render certain facility designs less competitive
- **Power availability** — grid constraints in key markets are becoming the binding constraint on growth
- **Customer concentration** — many data center platforms depend on a small number of hyperscale customers
- **Regulatory uncertainty** — growing scrutiny of energy consumption and water usage by data centers

## Looking Ahead

Digital infrastructure M&A activity is expected to remain robust through 2025 and beyond. The sector's growth fundamentals are strong, and the capital available for deployment continues to increase. We expect to see continued consolidation of mid-market platforms, expansion into emerging markets, and increasing convergence between traditional and digital infrastructure investment strategies.
